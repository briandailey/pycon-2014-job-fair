### PyCon 2014 Remote Hiring Survey

This data was collected at PyCon 2014 in Montreal, Quebec. Companies were asked
if they were open to hiring remote developers (outside any of their offices).

The CSV file included provides the company name, the city the company provided
as their headquarters, and their response.

#### Description of Data

- -1 - Company expressed no interest in hiring any remote developers
- 0 - Company expressed interest with limitations
- 1 - Company expressed interest in remote developers
- If the status is blank, then I was not able to get any information about the company.

Two companies present at PyCon closed their booth before I was able to ask them
any questions.


#### Summary

The average company at PyCon is slightly more disposed towards only hiring
on-site developers (with an average response of -0.022).

#### Contact Information

I hope to conduct this poll again next year in order to observe if there
is a trend towards remote work.
